<p align="center"><img src="Assets/banner.png"></p>

Frosty is a sophisticated rootkit malware developed specifically for Windows operating systems, with an emphasis on its compatibility and effectiveness with Windows 10.

A notable feature of Frosty is its use of Microsoft's Detours library. This strategic choice allows the malware to engage the Windows Native API (NTAPI), the application programming interfaces essential to the operating system's functions. Manipulating NTAPI allows Frosty to bypass conventional security measures and avoid detection by traditional methods.

**Note:** Frosty rootkit is in its early phase of development, therefore, we are in beta version. We await feedback on the rootkit so we can improve it.
