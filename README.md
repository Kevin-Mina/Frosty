Frosty is a sophisticated rootkit malware developed specifically for Windows operating systems, with an emphasis on its compatibility and effectiveness with Windows 10.

A notable feature of Frosty is its use of Microsoft's Detours library. This strategic choice allows the malware to engage the Windows Native API (NTAPI), the application programming interfaces essential to the operating system's functions. Manipulating NTAPI allows Frosty to bypass conventional security measures and avoid detection by traditional methods.

## Note

The Frosty rootkit is in its early development phase, so we are in beta. We welcome feedback on the rootkit so we can improve it.

This is one of my ambitious projects, as much as it is a ring 3 rootkit, it was a project in which I learned more internally about the Windows operating system. So if you find any bugs, please report them in `issues` so we can reach a final point and fix them.

## Changelog (v0.2b)

* Added suffix that allow user to customize their settings.
* New macro in `config.h` called `RK_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION` used to set the service description (if you want to change it).
* Hook the `AmsiScanBuffer` function from `amsi.dll` for evasion.
